90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text was tagged before; no proper YML file yet. Validated by Gowaart. Text is missing its introduction (vol. 1 pp. 3-5). Sections of the book had been tagged as biographies, which they aren't, this is a topographical work. There are still Quran tags in the text (@QB@, @QE@), I have left them in place. Some sections had titles spread over two lines, and some included a page number (always when a title starts a new page), both of which I corrected. Poetry was tagged incorrectly and is now corrected. 
 The second volume has several sections in square brackets with english titles. It's unclear who added these but they're doubtlessly useful for analysis so I have left them. They should maybe be translated into Arabic though. From Vol 2 p. 285 onwards is a dhayl, but it is unclear to me what the origin is of this dhayl and whether or not it was written by Nucaymi. Needs further investigation.
